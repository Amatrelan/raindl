** Before everything
i dev on linux, so if there is problem in windows side can't do much, tests runs on windows too so something is working.

* How
** Get url
=raindl -s bleach -e 1=
** Open directly in mpv
=raindl -s bleach -e 1 -w=

** Other
you can get all possible parameters with =raindl -h=

** Nice to have soon (if ever)
- cache / database so no need to query over internet all the time.
- ignore parameter, so if user don't wanna dubs then he can ignore those.
- more providers
- implement some tracker functionality
  + along with daemon mode for downloads
  + torrent support? ([subs-please])
- implement [[https://github.com/erengy/anime-relations][anime-relations]]
- a ton of more tests, there is so many different ways things can break right now

* Known problems.
- anime has "extra" episodes, for ex. =Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken 24.9=, won't work right now, you can watch normal episodes as is.
- only =mpv= supported with =-w= flag
